// Declaring variables with number values
const gravity = 9.81 // earth gravity  in m/s2
const boilingPoint = 100 // water boiling point, temperature in Â°C
const PI = 3.14 // geometrical constant
console.log(gravity, boilingPoint, PI)

// Variables can also be declaring in one line separated by comma, however I recommend to use a seperate line to make code more readble
let fName = 'Asabeneh', job = 'teacher', live = 'Finland'
console.log(fName, job, live)
